AR  Shopping Experience 
Abstract—Augmented Reality is reshaping the way people pursue interior design and shopping by allowing them to visualize their furniture, home appliances, and decor items directly in their actual spaces. Utilizing the capabilities of AR and mobile technology, we present DecorAR – an immersive and intuitive AR application that is designed to help users become better and more confident choices while shopping. Using Unity and ARCore, our system enables users to place, move, rotate, and scale multiple 3D models in their real environments using horizontal plane detection. DecorAR deals with a standard user concerns such as inaccurate spatial estimation, choosing the right size, and ensuring the design suits their space. The app was tested withdifferent types of objects in the real-world indoor spaces. Results showed significant improvements in space organization, increased accuracy in product placement, and higher satisfaction levels. By blending AR visualization with user-friendly controls and multiobject interaction capabilities, our system provides a convenient, flexible and immersive solution to improve the home shopping experience.
